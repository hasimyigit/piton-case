Note: 
* On the book detail page, I fetched the products belonging to a category and retrieved the product whose name matches the query parameter. Because the API named "name": "Product" wasn't working.
* Since I didn't receive a token during registration, I only created the sign-in page. I used the iron-session library to create my own token and stored it in a cookie.
* I used the react-hook-form library for form validation.
