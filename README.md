- Please review both branches.

"main" branch for Note: 
* On the book detail page, I fetched the products belonging to a category and retrieved the product whose name matches the query parameter. Because the API named "name": "Product" wasn't working.
* Since I didn't receive a token during registration, I only created the sign-in page. I used the iron-session library to create my own token and stored it in a cookie.
* I used the react-hook-form library for form validation.
  
"with-redux-toolkit" branch for Note:
* The data received from the API was added to the Redux store.
* I have added the validation processes to the UI in this branch.
* I used Zod for the validation processes.
* There were validation processes in the main branch, but they were not displayed in the UI.
